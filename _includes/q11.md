Fake News Challenge was conceived to inspire AI researchers and practitioners to work on fact-checking related problems. We are in touch with our journalist and fact-checker colleagues to understand what other problems they encounter in their day-to-day work and how that can inform FNC-2. Stay tuned for the next challenge. If you have suggestions, please stop by our [Slack](https://fakenewschallenge.slack.com) and leave a comment. We would love to hear from you!
